# Split Brood Set-Up

This protocol can be used to set up a split-brood experiment, starting
with a bulk culture, setting up egg-laying chambers and splitting into
experimental replicates. These are general instructions and should be
adjusted according to specific experimental treatments and needs.

1.  **Locate bulk culture:** Ensure that the bulk culture consists of
    young adults. Don’t hesitate to do a quick check of females (they
    mature slower than males) under a scope!

2.  **Materials prep**

    -   Estimate how many adults there are in the bulk culture. Prepare
        a 1L beaker filled with 100 mL of FSW for every 100 adults there
        are in the bulk culture and add a label that say, ‘exp. adults’.

    -   Prepare a small cube filled with ~2L FSW and 200 micron sieve
        egg-laying chamber for every ~100-200 adult copepods that the
        bulk culture is estimated to have. Be sure to label each cube
        with the date and a clear title.

    -   Prepare a cube to reestablish the bulk culture in with fresh FSW
        and a new label.

    -   Use a 60 micron sieve to reverse filter (drain) the bulk culture
        down to 1L in preparation for separation of adults from
        nauplii/copepodites. Don’t forget to thoroughly spray down the
        sieve.

3.  **Capture adults, reestablish bulk culture**

    -   Submerge a 200 micron sieve into the new bulk culture cube and
        pour the bulk culture through the sieve. This will catch all
        adults inside of the sieve and allow copepodites, nauplii and
        eggs to flow through the sieve and into the reestablished bulk
        culture.

    -   Lift 200 micron sieve with adults out of the bulk culture and
        rinse the adults into the 1L beaker labeled ‘exp. adults’. Rinse
        **carefully** and **thoroughly** as these are your experimental
        adults that you will leave to lay eggs.

4.  **Disperse experimental adults, establish egg-laying chambers**

    -   Gently stir the contents of the ‘exp. adults’ beaker to
        uniformly distribute the copepods.

    -   Immediately after stirring, distribute the same volume of adult
        copepods in FSW into each prepared egg-laying chamber. This will
        (approximately) evenly divide the experimental adults into each
        egg-laying chamber. For example, if you have ~400 adult copepods
        in 400 mL of FSW, pour 200 mL of the copepod/FSW solution into
        each of 2 egg-laying chambers. Rule of thumb is 100-200 adults
        per egg-laying chamber.

    -   Feed each new culture ~100 mL of algae. When feeding, pour algae
        into cube, NOT into egg-laying chamber and be sure to gently
        rock the egg-laying chamber to circulate the water and food.
        Ensure that the airstone is outside of the egg-laying chamber
        and also not pushed up against chamber.

5.  **Adults mate for 72 hours**

    -   Feedings can be ad libitum, based on the water quality/if you
        can see ample algae in the culture. When feeding, pour algae
        into cube, NOT into egg-laying chamber.

    -   rock egg-laying chamber daily to circulate water and food.

6.  **Count eggs, establish experimental replicates**

    -   After 72 hours, return the experimental adults to the bulk
        culture.

    -   Drain down each experimental cube to ~1L using a 60 micron sieve
        (rinse sieve thoroughly) and transfer the contents of the cube
        into a 1L beaker labelled ‘eggs’, carefully spraying down the
        sides and bottoms of the cubes. Eggs sink to the bottom, so it
        is very important to spray the cube down thoroughly.

    -   Once all experimental cubes have been consolidated into the 1L
        beaker, gently stir the contents of the beaker to uniformly
        distribute the eggs within the water column.

    -   Using a gridded petri dish, count how many eggs are in 0.5 mL or
        1 mL of solution. Then, use this count to calculate how many
        eggs are in the total volume of solution in the ‘egg’ beaker.

    -   If you’ve estimated that you DO NOT have enough eggs to move
        forward with the experiment, return the eggs to the bulk culture
        and repeat this process once adults are present again!

    -   If you’ve estimated that you have enough eggs to move forward
        with establishing experimental replicates, prepare your
        experimental replicate cubes with fresh FSW, food and clear
        labeling. Gently re-stir the ‘egg’ beaker and evenly distribute
        the solution among your experimental replicates. From this point
        on, ensure that each replicate is getting 800 ug C/L in their
        food. See algae cell counting protocol for more info on this.

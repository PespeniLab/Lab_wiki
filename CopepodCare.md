# Copepod Care Protocol 2023

Caring for the lab copepod cultures requires diligence, patience and
love! Please follow these directions closely, take detailed notes of
anything and everything, and never hesitate to reach out if you have
questions or have made a mistake!

Copepods are fed 800 ugC/L 3x a week on MWF, with 50% water changes 1x
week on Wednesday.

## Important general safety guidelines

-   wear gloves when closely handling cultures in order to prevent
    lotions and soaps from your hands getting into the cultures

-   only use materials labelled for use with copepods (and not materials
    from rm324 or rm009A)

-   always wait for materials to be fully dry before use if rinsed in
    the lab sink

-   always check the salinity of water/algae that you are planning to
    add to a culture and the salinity of the culture before adding, even
    if one or both were 30ppt the day before

## Feeding Prep:

-   Once a week, count algal cells to determine the volume of each
    phytoplankton species needed to ensure 800 ug C/L (see Algal Cell
    Counting protocol). *Before* counting algal cells, filter each
    species through a 30 micron sieve.

-   Based on algal cell counts, calculate the volume of each species
    needed to feed every copepod culture.

-   Retrieve 3 beakers from rm 106 and collect the algae from rm 220,
    one species per beaker. Wear gloves and be careful not to cross
    contaminate Tet, TW and Rhod cultures. If grow lights are on, be
    sure to wear protective glasses. Swirl carboys before pouring.

-   In rm 106, filter each algae species using a 30 micron mesh sieve

## Water Changes and Feeding:

-   Check the salinity of the stock FSW before beginning water changes
    (Ideal salinity is 30ppt, but a range from 29-31 is acceptable).
    Adjust as needed.

-   Remove air stone from culture.

-   Close lid and tightly seal before moving the culture from the
    incubator to the bench.

-   Check status of culture, and fill out culture log (stage, water
    quality, general notes) using a flashlight to see the copepods

-   Reverse filter (using 60 micron sieve) 50% of the total volume in
    the culture, taking care to rinse the sides of the container. Given
    the status of the culture, determine whether it would be beneficial
    to do a 75% water change or a full bucket change and 100% water
    change. Ask if you are unsure.

-   Rinse the filter with FSW, to remove any copepods pinned onto the
    mesh screen.

-   Check the salinity of the culture by sampling waste water from the
    bucket (the goal is to prevent a change of \> 2ppt between the
    culture and the new stock water, you may need to adjust the stock
    accordingly) and record in log.

-   Replace volume with clean, chilled FSW.

-   Stir algae and pour in calculated volume of each algal species into
    the culture.

-   Check culture to make sure copepods are not in distress.

-   Secure lid on the culture and return culture to the incubator.

-   Make sure that *the same* air stone is placed back in the container
    and bubbling at a slow steady rate. The airline control knob should
    be at ~45 degree angle.

-   Make sure the lid is left ajar.

-   For each culture, use a different 60 micron sieve. At the end of
    water changes, rinse all materials with boiling hot tap water and
    leave to dry on shelving, *not* in drying rack if possible.

## Making FSW:

To make one large cube of FSWâ€¦ - collect UltraPure filtered water from
rm 009 in the basement of MLS.

-   Back in rm 106, add ~2 scoops of Instant Ocean and stir well. Ensure
    that you are wearing gloves to prevent lotions and soaps from
    contaminating the water.

-   Adjust salinity by adding salt or more UltraPure water until 30 ppt
    is reached.

-   Store FSW on the bottom shelf of the appropriate incubator (based on
    temperature) *with* a large airstone to aerate the FSW

# Pespeni lab gel protocol

We are currently using TAE buffer for our gels. 

The small gel rig takes a 40-50 ml gel. Because we’re using EZ vision loading dye, no need to add anything to the gel.

### Gel Recipe

1% gel:
- .5 g agarose
- 50 ml water

We've been using RO water with no issues.

After melting in the microwave (watch so it doesn't boil over), let cool for a few min, then add Gel Red at 1:10,000x dilution. So 5ul in 50ml gel.

Once cooled enough that it won't melt the gel rig (you should be able to touch the flask briefly), pour gel, add appropriate comb. Let solidify- about 30 min.

Make sure there's enough buffer in the gel rig so it is filled to the line.

### Loading gel

EZ vision loading dye is 1:5 ratio with your DNA. ie, 1ul dye, 5 ul DNA.

Depending on what you're doing, you can cut down the amount do DNA and make it up with water.

Include the appropriate ladder for your sample. Ladder should be diluted down to ~100 ng/ul.

On parafilm, pipette out 1 ul dye/sample (and ladder).

Add 5 ul sample (or ladder).

Add full sample to gel.

### General run times and temps:

- Checking for PCR product: 1% gel at 100v for ~30 min.  
- Resolving ATAC bands: 2% gel at 60V for ~60 min.  


### Imaging

still to come...

### Other notes:

If you’re just trying to see if there is product, I’d argue that you can reuse gels. They will get ugly, but that’s OK. Just put them in an erlenmeyer flask and cover with foil. Re-melt when you need to use again. You can add ~2ul gel red each time you melt it down.

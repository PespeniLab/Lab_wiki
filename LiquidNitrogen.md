# Liquid Nitrogen Protocol (for freezing copes)

Ensure that you are wearing close toed shoes, pants and long sleeves!!!

1.  Remove as much water as possible from 1.5 mL tubes with specimens

2.  Retrieve dewar container from 324

3.  Bring samples and container to MLS rm 335

4.  Sign in, record that you will use 0.25 L

5.  Put on protective gloves and face covering

6.  Open dewar container, place end of hose inside and turn knob

    1.  once flow starts, don’t turn off until you have the sufficient
        amount or the hose may freeze

7.  Fill container ~1/4 full,

8.  Hold each sample in liquid nitrogen using long tongs until frozen in the bottom of the tube (~3-5 seconds depending on volume); make sure you're wearing protective gloves; place lid on dewar.

    1. turn off by tightening the knob however do NOT crank the knob closed
    as tight as you can- this may cause the knob to get stuck. Close just
    until you reach resistance (don’t overthink it)

9.  After a few minutes, fish samples out of dewar using long tongs and place in labeled freezer box.

10. Place samples in -80C freezer in basement with appropriate labels
    and organization

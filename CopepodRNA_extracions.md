# Trizol Chloroform + RNeasy RNA extraction for copes frozen in salt water

Samples:

Method a modified version of Whitehead small tissue and from Boles-
2018-01-04

Note: TRIzol & chloroform are carcinogens & corrosive = work in the
hood. Dispose of waste properly. This is assay uses both phenol- and
column based methodology to extract total RNA.

Before Starting: 1. Keep everything clean. RNases are everywhere,
especially on you. 2. Chill trizol prior to use. 3. Make up 70% etoh
fresh. make ~300 ul/sample for copes

## Part 1:

1.  Add 200ul trizol to frozen sample- Thaw on ice

2.  Transfer to 1.5 ml tube (assuming they’re in cryovials).

3.  Spin at 12,000 g at 4C for 1 min

4.  Remove liquid, leave copes

5.  Add 50ul trizol (cold)

6.  Homogenize with pestle, 40x

7.  Rinse pestle with 350ul trizol

8.  Keep on ice until ready for the 5 min incubation.

9.  Incubate at RT for 5 minutes; Vortex every 30 seconds

10. Transfer sample to clean, labeled 1.5mL tube

11. Add 300 uL chloroform per 1ml trizol, mix by inversion. 150ul for
    copes in 400ul trizol

12. Incubate 5 min at room temperature. Invert every minute to mix

13. Centrifuge 15,000g; 4C; 15-30 min

14. Pipette off clear, aqueous top layer into a new tube. ~60% original
    Trizol vol.

    1.  The mixture will separate into a clear upper aqueous phase, a
        cloudy interphase, and a pink lower organic (phenol/ chloroform)
        phase. Take care to not get any of the other phase. If you mess
        up, vortex homogenate, re-centrifuge, and try again

    2.  If clear layer isn’t on top, add ~100ul chloroform, respin. Pink
        on bottom is right

    3.  Keep aqueous supernatant on ice

15. Add equal volume 70% EtOH (fresh daily; make ~400 ul/sample for
    copes) to each sample supernatant; pipette to mix.

## Part 2: Qiagen Kit:

1.  Transfer 700uL of the sample to Qiagen RNeasy spin column

    1.  Centrifuge 8,000g (\> 10,000 rpm); 30 seconds at Room temp

    2.  Discard filtrate. RNA is now on the column

    3.  Repeat a and b until all sample is washed through spin-column.
        Do not add more than 700ul at a time.

2.  Add 700uL RW1 buffer to sample column

    1.  Centrifuge 8,000g; 15 seconds; RT

    2.  Discard filtrate and save collection tube

3.  Add 500uL RPE to each column

    1.  Centrifuge 8,000g; 15 seconds; RT

    2.  Discard filtrate and save collection tube

4.  Add 500uL RPE buffer to each column

    1.  Centrifuge 8,000g; 2 minutes; RT

    2.  Discard filtrate

5.  Transfer column to new 2 ml collection tube (Qiagen provided)

    1.  Centrifuge 16,100g; 1 min; RT. Gets rid of any RPE carryover.

6.  Put sample column in tube labeled for storage 1.5mL tube

7.  Add 65uL nuclease-free water directly to membrane; incubate RT; 1
    min

8.  Centrifuge 8,000g; RT; 1 min

    1.  Save filtrate, as this is your eluted RNA.

9.  Re-run flow through containing rna through membrane; incubate RT; 1
    min

10. Centrifuge 8,000g; RT; 1 min

11. Save filtrate, as this is your eluted RNA. Around 60ul total

12. Aliquot ~5uL in for bioanalyzer and Qubit analyses. Store all RNA at
    -80C

# Algal Cell Counting with a Hemocytometer

1.  collect a small amount of algae from MLS rm 220.

2.  combine 10 microliters of Lugol’s solution (in rm 326 fridge) with
    100 microliters of algae in a PCR tube and invert to mix.

3.  bring 20 micropipette, and hemocytometer, and sample to Miroscope
    Room in basement of MLS (left through double doors).

4.  pipette 15 ul onto hemocytometer and cover with a cover slip.

5.  visually assess the four corners and determine which corner (4x4
    grids) appears to have the most and least number of cells.

6.  count all of the algal cells within these two corners and input
    average into the [Carbon Conent
    Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11U99FCzyJtTwI5ec-p5dHOkcz7KrM66Or_8A4uRWPBI/edit#gid=56670135).

# Carbon Content Calculator:

1.  input average cell count (most counted + least counted/2) in 1 mL
    (don’t forget unit conversion here) nto the column titled
    “concentration (cells/mL)”.

2.  for a goal of 800 ug C/L, divide 800 by the number of different
    algae species you are using.

Note: V2 = the amount of ASW that you are adding the algae to, V1 = the
volume of each algae you should mix together to get 800 ug C/L.

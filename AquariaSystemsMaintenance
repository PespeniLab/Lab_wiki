### Maintaining aquaria systems

1) If needing to use an adult tank, make sure to set up 1 month in advance in order to establish the healthy bacteria needed for a happy tank.
- we will have 2 tanks going at all times as backup in case anyone needs a tank more immediately.
-for setting up a tank, you'll want to add freshly made artificial seawater and then ammonium chloride (3mg/L & tanks are 20L). 
Check ammonia levels, but they should go down as bacteria grow. Keeping adding some each week as you're establishing the tank. 
Can also seed with seawater from another adult tank.

2) After you finish using an adult tank, they need to be cleaned and rinsed thoroughly with RO, making sure to run RO through the pump 
and protein skimmer, and then dry the tank out and let sit dry.

3) Before using a tank for an experiment, you are going to want to make sure that the probe you are using has been calibrated
and that the solenoid valve has been inspected - there should be no water in them and they will need to be regreased.

4) For the larval system, when an experiment is done, it also needs to be thoroughly rinsed with RO water and then left sitting dry.

5) NO SOAP OR CHEMICALS should be used in or near the aquaria systems.
